        Bangladesh,[a] officially the People's 
        Republic of Bangladesh,
        [b] is a country in South Asia. It is 
        the eighth-most populous 
        country in the world and twelfth-most
         densely populated with a
        population of 174,655,977[18] in an area
         of 148,460 square kilometres
        (57,320 sq mi). Bangladesh shares land 
        borders with India to the north,
        west, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast.
         To the south, it has a 
        coastline along the Bay of Bengal.After the war
        , Sheikh Mujib became the 
        leader of the country. Mujib's 
        assassination in 1975 led to the rise of 
        Ziaur Rahman, who himself was assassinated in 1981.
         The 1980s was dominated 
        by the presidency of Hussain Muhammad Ershad,
         who was overthrown in a mass 
        uprising in 1990. After 1990, the "Battle of 
        the Begums" between Khaleda Zia 
        and Sheikh Hasina defined Bangladesh's politics 
        and history for next 34 years.
        [21][22][23] Following the overthrow of Hasina in
         a student–led mass uprising in 
        August 2024, an interim government led by Nobel Peace 
        laureate Muhammad Yunus took power.
        We, the people of Bangladesh, having proclaimed our 
        independence on the 26th day of March,
         1971 and through 2[a historic struggle for national
          liberation], established the independent, 
         sovereign People's Republic of Bangladesh;
        3[Pledging that the high ideals of nationalism,
         socialism, democracy and secularism, which 
        inspired our heroic people to dedicate themselves
         to, and our brave martyrs to sacrifice their 
        lives in, the national liberation struggle, shall
         be the fundamental principles of the Constitution;]
        process a socialist society, free from exploitation 
        a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human 
        rights and freedom, equality and justice, political, 
        economic and social, will be secured for all citizens;
        Bangladesh is part of the historic and ethnolinguistic 
        region of Bengal, which was divided during the Partition
         of British India in 1947 as the eastern exclave of the 
         Dominion of Pakistan.[19] Ancient Bengal was known as 
         Gangaridai and was a stronghold of pre-Islamic kingdoms.
          The Muslim conquest after 1204 led to the sultanate and
           Mughal periods, during which an independent Bengal 
        Sultanate and wealthy Mughal Bengal transformed the
        region into an important centre of regional affairs,
        trade, and diplomacy. The Battle of Plassey in 1757 
        marked the beginning of British rule for next 200 years.
        The creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 set a 
              precedent for the emergence of Bangladesh. The All-India
               Muslim League, which was founded in Dhaka in 1906,[20] 
               fought for a separate Bengali Muslim homeland in the 
               Eastern Bengal, which was proposed in the Lahore Resolution 
               in 1940 by A. K. Fazlul Huq, the first Prime Minister of Bengal. 
               The present-day territorial boundary was established with the 
               announcement of the Radcliffe Line.

             In 1947,
              East Bengal became the most populous province in the Dominion of
               Pakistan and was renamed East Pakistan, with Dhaka as the legislative 
               capital. The Bengali Language Movement in 1952, the 1958 Pakistani coup
                d'état, and the 1970 Pakistani general election spurred Bengali nationalism 
                and pro-democracy movements. The refusal of the Pakistani military junta to 
                transfer power to the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, triggered 
                the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The Mukti Bahini waged a successful 
                armed revolution; the conflict saw the Bangladeshi genocide. The country came
                 into existence on 16 December 1971 after the surrender of Pakistan, ending 
                 the 9-month long Liberation War.[19]

           After the war, Sheikh Mujib became the leader of the country. 
           Mujib's assassination in 1975 led to the rise of Ziaur Rahman,
            who himself was assassinated in 1981. The 1980s was dominated by

        To the north, it is separated from Bhutan 
        and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor, 
        and from China by the mountainous Indian 
        state of Sikkim. Dhaka, the capital 
        and largest city, is the nation's political,
         financial, and cultural centre.
        Chittagong is the second-largest city and the
